# Geopositioning-APP-NativePlugin-Version
This Android app allows users to track their current location using GPS or network-based positioning (Wi-Fi, mobile data), providing real-time feedback on latitude and longitude. Additionally, the app allows users to manually input a location (latitude and longitude) and receive a notification when the device is within 50 meters of that location.
